# WordCount Sublime Plugin

This is a very simple ST3 plugin to count words, characters, and lines in the current file.

## Installation

Simply put the entire `WordCount` directory into your ST3 `Packages` directory.

## Usage

You can choose which counts to show by modifying the settings file.

To show a popup with your selected counts, simply select "Word Count" from the context menu (right click in any file). Alternatively, press `ctrl+shift+c` on Windows or `command+shift+c` on Mac to show your selected counts in the status bar.
